## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

On this project, I customized a box-shadow from scratch for the first time. I had the opportunity to better understand it's properties and parameters. 
After some feedback, I've improves and updated the project to include hover properties for the button and convert the px and vh units into rem units for better responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [CSS box-shadow property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.php) - This helped me understand the parameters of box-shadow and how to customize it.
- [Understanding and using rem units in CSS](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/) - This helped me understand the equivalent proportions of rem units to px and vh.
